<h2 id="problem"> üåü Problem Statement </h2>

Given `n` items to deliver and a fleet of `m` riders, (`n` > `m`), and some `k` dynamically added pickup points. Optimize for `n` items and at most `m` tours,
also considering the cases where `k` >= `0` and points are added or deleted from the original route.

The Objectives are:

1. A tool that accurately estimates the `length`, `breadth`, `height` and `volumetric weight` of an item with a small margin of error. The product developed 
should be easy to use, reproducible and reusable. Bonus points will be awarded, if erroneous objects can be flagged on a conveyor.

2. An effective route planning system to cluster items into different tours that maximize the number of items delivered in each route of the tour,
`maximizing the on-time delivery percentage and minimizing overall distance travelled` on all routes combined with minimum tours/riders
involved in fulfilment. While route planning, maximizing the output of riders by smart bag creation/clustering to get the best out of riders and routes.
This Route planning system should also have the ability to add pickup points dynamically for multi-pickup cases by selecting the correct
rider/tour, reroute their routes to cater pickups along with their ongoing tour and consider the rider bag capacity as well. 

3. A basic platform ( `web` / `app` ) to fit all these objectives together where points can be added or removed dynamically. The app is expected to
support navigation on a map by prompting the best route between any two points on the tour for riders. The app needs to be integrated with Challenge-1 for the rider-bag problem.
